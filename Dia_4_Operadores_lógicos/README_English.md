What this code does:

Checks whether a user can access a program based on age, registration status, and acceptance of terms of use. If any requirement is not met, access is denied; otherwise, access is granted.

Purpose
Demonstrate basic decision-making logic using user input and conditional statements in Python.

Concepts practiced

User input handling

Type conversion (string to integer)

Logical operators (or)

Conditional structures (if / else)

Notes for reviewers:
This is a simple exercise focused on core Python fundamentals. Input validation and normalization were intentionally kept minimal to match the exercise scope and avoid overengineering. The goal is to demonstrate clear logical reasoning at a junior Python level.

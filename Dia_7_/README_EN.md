What this code does

This code collects descriptions of completed tasks from the user and prints them sequentially during execution, simulating a simple task list.

Purpose

This exercise demonstrates how to iterate over predefined values and collect user input when the use of lists is intentionally restricted.

Concepts practiced

for loop

Tuple iteration

User input with input()

String formatting with f-strings

Basic variable assignment

Notes for reviewers

This code was intentionally written without using lists.
A tuple was used only as a fixed sequence to control the loop and visually represent task order.
Each task description is printed immediately because storing multiple values was outside the allowed rules of the exercise.
This reflects a learning-focused constraint, not a production-ready solution.

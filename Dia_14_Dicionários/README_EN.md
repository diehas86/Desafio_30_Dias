What this code does
Implements a simple command-line user registry that allows adding users with name and age, searching for a specific user, listing all registered users, and exiting the program.

Purpose
Demonstrate the basic use of dictionaries to store and retrieve structured data entered by the user through a menu-driven interface.

Concepts practiced

Dictionaries (key-value structure)

User input and output

Type conversion

Conditional logic

Loop control

Basic error handling with try/except

Notes for reviewers
This is an introductory-level exercise focused on understanding how dictionaries work in practice. The goal is clarity and correct use of core Python concepts rather than advanced design or scalability.

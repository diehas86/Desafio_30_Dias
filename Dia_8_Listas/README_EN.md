What this code does

This code implements a simple command-line menu that allows the user to manage a shopping list.
The user can add items, remove items, check if an item exists, display all items, or exit the program.

Purpose

This exercise demonstrates the basic use of lists combined with loops and conditional logic to build an interactive menu-driven program, focusing on clarity and fundamental Python concepts.

Concepts practiced

Lists

while loop

if / elif / else

User input handling

Basic list operations (append, remove, membership check with in)

Notes for reviewers

This code was written as part of a beginner-level Python learning path, targeting Python Junior interview preparation.
The focus is on fundamental logic and readability rather than advanced validation or optimization.
Input normalization, error handling with exceptions, alphabetical sorting, and duplicate item management were intentionally not implemented to keep the solution aligned with the exercise scope and current learning stage.

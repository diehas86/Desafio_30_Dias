What this code does

This code implements a simple support ticket system that allows users to register new support calls, validate input data, store the calls in memory, and list all registered calls through a menu-driven interface.

Purpose

This exercise demonstrates how to structure a small interactive program, validate user input without advanced error handling, and manage data using basic Python constructs suitable for a junior-level scenario.

Concepts practiced

Functions with return values

Input validation without try/except

while loops and control flow

Lists and dictionaries

Menu-based program structure

Notes for reviewers

This code was written as part of daily Python practice focused on building a solid junior foundation. The goal is clarity, correctness, and the ability to explain the logic during a technical interview, rather than advanced features or optimizations.

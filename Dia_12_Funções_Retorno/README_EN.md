What this code does
Implements a simple console-based system to register student grades, calculate the average, and determine whether the student is approved or not based on the calculated average.

Purpose
Demonstrate the correct use of functions with return values, data flow between functions, and basic program control using a menu-driven approach.

Concepts practiced

Functions with parameters and return values

Lists for data storage

Conditional statements

Basic input validation

Control flow with while loop and menu

Notes for reviewers
This is a learning exercise aimed at consolidating Python fundamentals. The focus is on clarity, correct logic flow, and understanding how functions communicate through return values, rather than advanced patterns or optimizations.

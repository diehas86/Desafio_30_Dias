What this code does
Implements a password verification system allowing the user a limited number of attempts. The program grants access if the correct password is entered and denies access after the attempts are exhausted.

Purpose
Demonstrates understanding of loops, conditionals, and state control using variables in Python.

Concepts practiced

while loop

if/else conditionals

Variable manipulation

Basic input/output

Notes for reviewers
This is a beginner-level exercise focused on controlling program flow without using break, try/except, external libraries, or advanced structures. It shows handling a simple real-world scenario with clear logic.

Basic restrictions followed

No break statement used

No exception handling (try/except)

No external libraries

No for loops

Only simple variables used

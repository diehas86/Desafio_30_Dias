What this code does
This code implements a simple command-line task manager. It allows the user to add tasks, list all registered tasks with numbering, and exit the program through a menu-driven interface. The program also prevents invalid inputs, such as non-numeric menu options and empty task descriptions.

Purpose
This exercise demonstrates how to structure a small interactive Python program using clear functions, basic input validation, and readable control flow, following expectations for a Python Junior level.

Concepts practiced

Functions and separation of responsibilities

while loop for continuous execution

if / elif / else control flow

Lists and basic list operations

Input validation with try / except (ValueError)

Boolean evaluation of empty values

enumerate for indexed output

Notes for reviewers
This code was written as part of a daily practice focused on building a solid Python Junior foundation. The emphasis is on clarity, correctness, and explaining decisions, rather than advanced features or external libraries.

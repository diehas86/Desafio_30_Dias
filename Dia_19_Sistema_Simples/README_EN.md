What this code does

Implements a simple terminal-based service menu that allows the user to choose between predefined options, validates numeric input, executes actions based on the selection, and keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

Purpose

This exercise demonstrates how to structure a small interactive system using clear control flow, input validation, and basic function separation, following Python Junior best practices.

Concepts practiced

Input validation

While loop control

Conditional statements (if / elif / else)

Functions with clear responsibility

Basic user interaction in terminal

Notes for reviewers

This is a learning-focused exercise developed at a Python Junior level, emphasizing clarity, organization, and correct decision-making logic rather than system complexity.
